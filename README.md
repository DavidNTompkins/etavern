Any good code here is likely just from https://github.com/spite/FaceMeshFaceGeometry, and then chopped to bits. If you're looking at this in hopes of using it for another purpose, I'd strongly recommend going back to the original. The only exception might be if you're specifically looking at the peer2peer connections - in which case look at Muaz Khan's rtcmulticonnection.
